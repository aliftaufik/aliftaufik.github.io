# About This Site
This site is used as my personal portofolio website. As the time goes, and my experience and the number of completed projects grow, I put all that accomplishment here, to show off to prospective clients and for myself to reflect back to what I'd finished and decide where I should go next.

# About Me
I'm a future full-stack engineer. Right now I'm studying full-stack immersive program at Hacktiv8. Hopefully in 4,5 months I will be able to develop webapps and Android/iOS apps from scratch, then start my career and continue to grow as a developer in line with fast-paced innovation in technology.
